 * A struct is a collection of variables of different
 * data types under a single name. It has similar
 * characteristics to a class. Struct members have public
 * access by default while class members have private
 * access by default.
 *
 * Like a class, memory is allocated when a struct
 * is created or instantiated, but NOT when it's defined.
